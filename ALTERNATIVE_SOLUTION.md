## ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION: Use Firebase's Built-in Auth

Instead of Google OAuth (which requires verification), use Firebase's built-in authentication:

### How it works:
1. User clicks "Get your own IMPACT System"
2. They enter their email and create a password
3. Firebase creates their account automatically
4. Your system provisions their Firebase project
5. They get their own isolated instance

### Benefits:
✅ No Google OAuth verification required
✅ Works for anyone, anywhere
✅ No test users needed
✅ Truly public access
✅ Simple email/password registration

### Implementation:
1. Replace OAuth flow with Firebase Auth
2. Use Firebase's built-in user management
3. Provision projects using your service account
4. Each user gets their own Firebase project

### User Experience:
- Click "Get Started"
- Enter email and password
- Click "Create Account"
- System automatically provisions their instance
- They get their own URL immediately

This approach uses Firebase's own authentication system, which doesn't have the same verification requirements as Google OAuth.
