## SOLUTION: Auto-Add Users to Test Users List

When a user tries to access your app and gets blocked, automatically add them to your OAuth consent screen's test users list.

### How it works:
1. User clicks "Get your own IMPACT System"
2. They get redirected to Google OAuth
3. If they get "Access blocked" error, your app detects this
4. Your Firebase Function automatically adds their email to test users
5. User gets redirected back and can now access the app

### Implementation:
1. Create a Firebase Function that adds emails to test users
2. Detect when users get blocked and call this function
3. Use Google Cloud API to programmatically add test users
4. Redirect user back to try again

### Benefits:
✅ No manual intervention needed
✅ Works for anyone who tries to access your app
✅ Automatic user management
✅ Seamless user experience
